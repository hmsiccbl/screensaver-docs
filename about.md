# Screensaver HTS LIMS

Screensaver is an open source, web-based lab information management system (LIMS) developed at and used by the ICCB-Longwood Screening Facility to address the informatics needs of our small molecule and RNAi screens. Screensaver was first launched in 2007. A revised, updated version of Screensaver was recently launched on December 1st, 2018. 

Screensaver supports the storage and comparison of screening data sets, as well as the management of information about screens, screeners, libraries, and laboratory work requests.
