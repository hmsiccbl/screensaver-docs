# Library Screening Visit

A **Library screening visit** records the reagents and volumes used for the high throughput screening process.

When screens are conducted at the facility, the plates of one or more library copies are used to produce the assay plates used for screening. The usage of library copy plates is tracked in Screensaver by adding new "Library Screening" activities. Each library screening activity tracks the set of library copy plates that have been used, along with the volume of reagent that was taken from each library copy well and the number of assay plate replicates that were produced. In this way, the Screensaver database can be used calculate the number of times each copy has been used as well as the total consumed and remaining reagent volume of every library copy plate.
