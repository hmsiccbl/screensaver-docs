# Raw Data Transformer

Screening assay result data are detected by different **plate reader** devices. These devices produce **raw data** results in different formats including text or CSV.

The **Raw Data Transformer** utility in Screensaver provides  these functions:
* parsing of the raw data output by the plate reader devices,
* collation of the multiple **read-out types**, **replicates**, and **conditions** represented,
* association of the raw data results with plate and well information from Screensaver.

The data from the **Raw Data Transformer** may then be entered into [Screen Result File Format](screenresult-file-format.html) and uploaded to Screensaver.
